# Routing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the **Routing** workflow using LangGraph.

The workflow routes user input to the appropriate AI task (story, joke, or poem) based on structured output from an augmented LLM. Conditional edges ensure the correct path is taken dynamically.

## Contents
- `routing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file with LangGraph workflow.

## Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the workflow and see dynamic routing of AI tasks.
